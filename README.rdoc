= devise_facebook_open_graph

The goal of this gem is to give Devise the ability to authorize users based if they are connected to Facebook or not.
It relays on connection to Facebook set up via the Facebook JavaScript SDK.




= How to get started

== Get facebook credentials, add ids and keys to a configuration file

If you haven't done so already, create a facebook application so you'll acquire an application id, secret and an API key.
You can register applications here: http://www.facebook.com/developers/.

DeviseFacebookOpenGraph provides a class for easy access to configuration values. These are by default read from
Rails.root/config/facebook.yml which should look something like this:

  production: &production
    application_id: ""
    api_key: ""
    application_secret: ""
    
  development:
    <<: *production




== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
